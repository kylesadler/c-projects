Implement, compile, and test the programs umfpack-demo2.c and umfpack-demo3.c.


The matrix A on our programs has an entry of 3.0 in its first column and second row. Copy umfpack-demo3.c to umfpack-demo4.c and modify umfpack-demo4.c so that the entry is specified twice: once as 1.0, and once again as 2.0. Entries in the triplet form accumulate; therefore that change should not affect the result. See if your program confirms that.
